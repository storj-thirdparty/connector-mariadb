## Config Files

There are two config files that contain Storj network and MariaDB connection information.  The tool is designed so you can specify a config file as part of your tooling/workflow.  



##### `db_property.json`

Inside the `./config` directory there is a  `db_property.json` file, with following information about your MariaDB instance:

* `hostName`- Host Name connect to MariaDB
* `port` - Port connect to MariaDB
* `username` - User Name of MariaDB
* `password` - Password of MariaDB
* `database` - MariaDB Database Name



##### `storj_config.json`

Inside the `./config` directory a `storj_config.json` file, with Storj network configuration information in JSON format:

* `apiKey` - API Key created in Storj Satellite GUI (mandatory)
* `satellite` - Storj Satellite URL (mandatory)
* `encryptionPassphrase` - Storj Encryption Passphrase (mandatory)
* `bucket` - Name of the bucket to upload data into (mandatory)
* `uploadPath` - Path on Storj Bucket to store data (optional) or "/" (mandatory)
* `serializedAccess` - Serialized access shared while uploading data used to access bucket without API Key (mandatory)
* `allowDownload` - Set *true* to create serialized access with restricted download (mandatory while using *share* flag)
* `allowUpload` - Set *true* to create serialized access with restricted upload (mandatory while using *share* flag)
* `allowList` - Set *true* to create serialized access with restricted list access
* `allowDelete` - Set *true* to create serialized access with restricted delete
* `notBefore` - Set time that is always before *notAfter*
* `notAfter` - Set time that is always after *notBefore*



## Run

Once you have built the project run the following commands as per your requirement:

##### Get help

```
$ ./connector-mariadb --help
```

##### Check version

```
$ ./connector-mariadb --version
```

##### Create back-up from MariaDB and upload them to Storj

```
$ ./connector-mariadb store --mariab <path_to_maria_config_file> --storj <path_to_storj_config_file>
```

##### Create back-up from MariaDB and upload it to Storj bucket using Access Key

```
$ ./connector-mariadb store --accesskey
```

##### Create back-up from MariaDB and upload it to Storj and generate a Shareable Access Key based on restrictions in `storj_config.json`

```
$ ./connector-mariadb store --share
```
